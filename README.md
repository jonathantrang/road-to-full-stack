# road_to_full_stack

A collection of code throughout my coding journey as I begin once again at 0.
As the days go by I will continue to update this. Consider this as a journal.

Day 1 - 2/27/2023
A. Relearned how to use git/github: - Learned how to add, remove, and rename files, directories - Learned how to push and commit these updates
B. Relearned how to create an HTML boilerplate.
