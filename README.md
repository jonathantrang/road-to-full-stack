# road_to_full_stack

A collection of code throughout my coding journey as I begin once again at 0.
As the days go by I will continue to update this. Consider this as a journal.

Day 1 - 2/27/2023
A. Relearned how to use git/github: - Learned how to add, remove, and rename files, directories - Learned how to push and commit these updates
B. Relearned how to create an HTML boilerplate.

- Consists of the tags:
  - <!DOCTYPE>
  - <html> <!-- establishes the root element of the document, any element after is a descendant -->
  - <head> <!-- contains meta-data -->
  - <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- ensures characters are displayed properly -->
  - <title> <!-- provides the name of the document, displayed on the tab of a browser -->
  - <body> <!-- visible information that is portrayed to the user -->
